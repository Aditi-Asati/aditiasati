The first term in the objective function is the training error (also called empirical risk of a predictor function) in terms of linear least squares error. The second term is the regularization term penalizing functions which have large L2-norm squared.\nLinear methods like ridge regression work best when the underlying dataset is sort of linear. However, when we use linear methods to model a non-linear dataset, the machine learning model often tends to underfit the dataset as the model class is not strong enough to predict well on such a dataset.\nKernel methods were introduced to overcome this problem. Kernel methods allow us to implement linear methods on a non-linear dataset by implicitly embedding the input into a high-dimensional euclidean space in which the data-points become linear.\nIn this blog, we will learn how to kernelize the Ridge Regression algorithm and also see an implementation of it using scikit-learn library.\nFor we begin, let\u0026rsquo;s familiarize ourselves with two terms which we will use later on.\nA kernel function takes two points in the input space $\\mathcal{X}$ and maps them to a real number. Mathematically speaking, a kernel function is a function $k : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ where $\\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers. Intuitively, kernel function measures how ”similar” two points are in the feature space. Now that we have understood what kernel functions are, let us understand kernel matrix.\nGiven a kernel function $k$ and a set of points $x_1, \u0026hellip;, x_n \\in \\mathcal{X}$, the corresponding kernel matrix is defined as $K = (k(x_i, x_j))_{i,j \\in n \\times n}$. So each $ij$-th entry in the kernel matrix $K$ is the value of the kernel function at points $x_i$ and $x_j$. We are now ready to derive the kernel version of the Ridge Regression algorithm.\nThe idea is to rewrite the optimization problem of the Ridge Regression algorithm in terms of the kernel function or the kernel matrix. To this end, we will invoke the Representer theorem which basically states that for an optimization problem of the form: $$ \\min_{w \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\left( R_n(w) + \\lambda \\Omega(|w|_{\\mathcal{H}}) \\right) $$\n$\\quad$ where:\n$R_n$ is the empirical risk (training error) $\\Omega$ is the regularizer function $\\lambda$ is the tradeff constant $\\mathcal{H}$ is the euclidean feature space $w$ is a vector in $\\mathcal{H}$ $\\mathcal{H}$ is actually the space of all real-valued functions from the input space $X$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. It is infact a vector space. The solution exists and is given by: $${w^* = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i k(X_i, \\cdot)}$$\n$\\quad$ where:\n$\\alpha_i$ is a real number for all $i$ $k(X_i, .)$ is a function from the input space to $\\mathbb{R}$. Notice that the optimization problem in Ridge Regression appears in the same form as mentioned in the Representer theorem. Hence, we can apply the theorem and obtain a solution $w$ of the Ridge Regression problem as a linear combination of input points in the feature space:\n$$w = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j\\Phi(X_j)$$\nNow this $w$ can be substituted back into the above ridge regression problem yielding the following optimization problem in terms of the kernel matrix $K$:\n$$\\min_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} \\frac{1}{n} \\lVert Y - K\\alpha \\rVert_2^2 + \\lambda \\alpha^T K \\alpha$$\nThe solution to this optimization problem can be derived analytically. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the derivation:\nStep 1: The objective function in the above optimization problem is\n$$Obj(\\alpha) := \\frac{1}{n} \\lVert Y - K\\alpha \\rVert_2^2 + \\lambda \\alpha^T K \\alpha$$\nIt is a convex function, therefore, any local minima is already a global minima of the function. Hence, it is enough to find one local minima of the objective function.\nStep 2: In order to find a local minima, we will take the derivative of the objective function with respect to $\\alpha$ and set it to 0:\n$$grad(Obj)(\\alpha) = -\\frac{1}{n}K^T(y-K\\alpha) + \\lambda K\\alpha + 0$$\n(Note that $K$ is symmetric)\n$$K(-y + K\\alpha + n\\lambda \\alpha) = 0$$\nThis implies $$\\alpha = (K + n\\lambda I)^{-1}Y.$$\nAnd we have obtained the solution of the Kernel Ridge Regression problem!!\nNow lets also formulate the evaluation function $f(x)$ in terms of the kernel function, after all the essence of kernelizing an algorithm is to write the optimization problem and the evaluation/ target function in terms of the kernel function/ kernel matrix.\n$$f(x) = \\langle w, \\Phi(x) \\rangle = \\langle w, k(x, .) \\rangle$$\nNote that $\\Phi(x) = k_x = k(x, .)$. Substituting the value of w (given by the representer theorem) into the above equation yields the following:\n$$f(x) = \\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i k(X_i, \\cdot), k(x,.) \\rangle$$\n$$f(x) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\langle k(X_i, .),k(x,.) \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\langle \\Phi(X_i),\\Phi(x) \\rangle$$\nNote that $k(x,y) = \\langle \\Phi(x), \\Phi(y) \\rangle$. For more details regarding it, read here. $$f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n\\alpha_ik(X_i, x)$$\nWe have finally obtained the target function for the kernel ridge regression algorithm. Observe that the function depends only on the kernel and not on the input points explicitly as discussed earlier.\nNow, lets look at the implementation of the Kernel Ridge Regression algorithm using scikit-learn library.\nWe will begin by installing necessary dependencies. Run the following command on the terminal.\npip install scikit-learn For demonstration, we will use the diabetes toy dataset present in the scikit-learn library.\nLets now import the required utilities.\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes from sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error We will now load the diabetes dataset and extract the data matrix and the target array.\ndiabetes = load_diabetes() data = diabetes.data target = diabetes.target Its time to split the dataset into train and test sets in order to evaluate the generalization performance of the Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) model and also to avoid overfitting.\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, target, test_size=0.2) We will be tuning the hyperparameters of the KRR model using Gridsearch cross validation method.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to always tune the hyperparameters of any machine learning model since the performance of the model is very sensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters. As an example, think of how changing the regularization constant in KRR algorithm can affect the training of the model. krr_model = KernelRidge() param_grid = {\u0026#34;alpha\u0026#34;: [1e-5, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2], \u0026#34;kernel\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;linear\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rbf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;poly\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sigmoid\u0026#34;, ]} grid_search = GridSearchCV(krr_model, param_grid, scoring=\u0026#34;neg_mean_absolute_error\u0026#34;, n_jobs=-1, cv=5) To understand Grid search cross validation, read here. Lets train our KRR model on the diabetes dataset and get the best hyperparameter values along with the trained model.\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train) best_params = grid_search.best_params_ print(best_params) best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_ Now that we have trained our KRR model, its time to make predictions on the test set and compute the performance metrics on both the training and test sets.\npredictions = best_model.predict(X_test) test_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions) test_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions) train_predictions = best_model.predict(X_train) train_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_train, train_predictions) train_mse = mean_squared_error(y_train, train_predictions) print(f\u0026#34;Test MAE : {test_mae} and Test MSE : {test_mse}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Train MAE : {train_mae} and train MSE : {train_mse}\u0026#34;) Here\u0026rsquo;s the full code: Woohoo!
